# Environment Variable Override Feature Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the environment variable override feature added to the ezcaACMEAgent Makefile.

## Features Implemented

1. **Direct Environment Variable Overrides**
   - Override any environment variable by setting AA_ prefixed environment variables
   - Values are passed directly to Docker without requiring special syntax
   - Works with all run and build targets

2. **Build-time Environment Variable Overrides**
   - Override build arguments during Docker image building
   - Set AA_ prefixed environment variables to override build args
   - Preserves the AA_ prefix when passing to Docker build
   - Dockerfile ARG parameters already include the AA_ prefix

3. **Custom Environment File Generation**
   - Generate customized environment files from base configurations
   - Combines base environment file with AA_ prefixed environment variables

## Implementation Details

### Makefile Changes

- Added detection and forwarding of AA_ prefixed environment variables to Docker
- Modified run targets to work with environment variables
- Added `generate-env-file` target to create custom environment files
- Updated help text with examples and documentation

### Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with feature overview
- Enhanced AUTH_METHODS.md with detailed examples
- Added example scripts in the examples/ directory

## Usage Examples

### Runtime Overrides

```powershell
# Basic override
AA_TenantId=my-tenant-id make run

# Multiple overrides with specialized run target
AA_ClientId=new-id AA_ClientSecret=new-secret make run-spsecret
```

### Build-time Overrides

```powershell
# Build with overrides
AA_DefaultConfig=production make build

# Build specific version with overrides
VERSION=1.0.0 AA_DefaultConfig=production make build-version
```

### Custom Environment Files

```powershell
# Generate custom environment file
OUTPUT_ENV_FILE=custom.env.list ENV_FILE=env.spsecret.list AA_ClientId=my-id make generate-env-file

# Use custom environment file
ENV_FILE=custom.env.list make run
```

## Benefits

- More natural, standard way to pass environment variables
- No need to modify original env.list files
- Directly compatible with CI/CD systems that set environment variables
- Simplified testing of different configurations
- Better security by keeping secrets out of source control
